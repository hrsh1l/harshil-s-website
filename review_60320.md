# i) Interest of Content
Content seems unrelated to computing, and some pages are devoid of content entirely apart from unloaded images.

# ii) Consistency and Quality of Visual Presentation
Style is consistent, but not aesthetically pleasing. Not enough content to provide an accurate ranking, as there is only 1 other functional page outside the home page.

# iii) Quality of Written Presentation
There is very little written content, which, while of reasonable quality, is far too sparse.

# iv) Validity of HTML
All images except one have been incorrectly linked, so do not display.
The linked Javascript file does not load correctly.
The other HTML elements are valid.
